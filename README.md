# Abstract view
When the user starts the program they will have the option to set a timed interval for the breaks. Each break is set for 20% of the interval set at the start of the program. So if the user set 20 minutes they will be able to use the computer for 20 minutes then be blocked for 4 minutes. When they window is blocked a JFrame will block the entire screen, play some music, and prevent the user from closing the program at all costs. The program can be closed while not on a break.
